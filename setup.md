# Installing required software
You will need the following software:

* An SSH client
* A VNC client
* (optional) an SFTP or SCP client for file transfers

## Windows

### SSH
For Windows there's a big choice of SSH clients. The latest versions of Windows 10 have an SSH client built in. If you don't want to use this or have an older version of Windows then download [https://download.mobatek.net/2002020012904840/MobaXterm_Portable_v20.0.zip](MobaXTerm) or [https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe](PuTTY). 

### VNC
Download the [https://www.tightvnc.com/download/1.3.10/tightvnc-1.3.10_x86_viewer.zip](Tightvnc executable), extract the zip file and run the `vncviewer` executable.

## Linux

An SSH client is already built in. If you have administrator rights install the `realvnc-vnc-viewer`, `xtightvncviewer` or `gvncviewer` (also known as gtk-vnc) package from your package manager. Alternatively you can use the [https://www.tightvnc.com/download/2.8.3/tvnjviewer-2.8.3-bin-gnugpl.zip](TightVNC Java Edition).

## Mac

An SSH client is already built in. There are several VNC clients you can use:
* [https://github.com/boecko/chicken/releases/download/v2.2b3/Chicken_2.2b3.dmg](Chicken of VNC)
* [https://www.tightvnc.com/download/2.8.3/tvnjviewer-2.8.3-bin-gnugpl.zip](TightVNC Java Edition)
